Hi, there. I'm Grant, a quantitative analyst with risk management experience in the banking industry.  More than that, I'm a mathematics nerd who enjoys learning high-level concepts in my spare time.  This blog, The Lazy Mathematician, was born out of a desire to journal and showcase what I learn on my journey through mathematics, as well as to provide clean, concrete examples of challenging concepts. -->
